# mm-tools
Variety of tools for molecular mechanics computer simulations

* The programs and scripts are separated in categories related to the computational code or subject.
* The solutions here aim to work for the general cases but they are not extensively tested.
* Some codes are extremely simple and are meant for use as handy command line tools.


## Examples
The examples are primarily wrapped in Jupyter notebooks since they are rendered/previewed  directly on GiHub and to easy the narrative.

## Awk (GNU Awk)
Most of the awk scripts in this repository are written to avoid the unnecessary overhead for the task in question and to minimize the memory requirements. Some scripts are left unoptimized on purpose to be easy for further editing or development.
